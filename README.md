# BASIC INFO 


I've alredy made operating systems in the past, one of them being called GREG OS. I have a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b85lpqZ_iG4 (copy this into the browser to view.)

One fun fact about GREG OS was that it wass made to run on chromebooks or on very low end systems. 

This project I aim to improve GREG OS by hoprfully creating a better user interface, insted of a command-line interface I would love to use a gui interface. 


# HOW TO MAKE AN OS ON YOUR OWN

If you want to make it yourself, I HIGHLY recommend using something called Cosmos to make your OS. Its a very good place to start if your not familiar with assembly or C++. 

Cosmos, short for C# Open Source Managed Operating System, is a toolkit for creating operating systems. It's designed to work with Visual Studio for development. Despite its name, it supports various languages based on .NET, like VB.NET, Fortran, Delphi Prism, IronPython, and F#. Most of Cosmos and its core functions are written in C#, which is why it's named Cosmos.
